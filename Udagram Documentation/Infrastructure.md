# Udagram Infrastructure

The app uses 3 Amazon web services to be hosted on the cloud, and these services are as follows:
- S3; Udagram front end files are hosted on S3 via static hosting.
- Elastic Beanstalk; Udagram backend is hosted on Elastic Beanstalk.
- Amazon RDS; a Postgres Database is hosted there to be used by our app.

A demonstration of Udagram infrastructure is in the figure below
